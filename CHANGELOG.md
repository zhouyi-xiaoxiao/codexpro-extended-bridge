# Changelog

## 0.28.0

- Added `codexpro execute-handoff` as an opt-in local executor for `.ai-bridge/current-plan.md`.
- Added built-in local adapters for `opencode`, `pi`, and `codex`, plus a restricted `--command` template path for custom agents.
- Added `--dry-run`, `--yes`, timeout handling, stdout/stderr capture, `agent-status.md`, `implementation-diff.patch`, and `execution-log.jsonl` output.
- Kept `handoff_to_agent` planning-only; local execution is not exposed as a remote MCP tool.
- Added smoke coverage for dry-run previews, custom command validation, execution status, diff collection, and structured execution logging.
- Clarified that CodexPro is an official Developer Mode/MCP workflow, not a rate-limit bypass or model access provider.

## 0.27.2

- Added `handoff_to_agent` for file-based handoffs to Codex, OpenCode, Pi, or custom local implementation agents without executing local commands.
- Extended `.ai-bridge` with generic `agent-status.md`, `implementation-diff.patch`, and `execution-log.jsonl` files.
- Updated `read_handoff`, `codex_context`, Pro apply logging, docs, and smoke coverage for generic agent handoffs.
- Fixed secret detection so benign env-var references like `process.env.TOKEN` are not blocked or redacted as literal secrets.
- Shell-quoted generated agent command hints so model names cannot inject extra shell tokens.
- Bounded append-mode handoff reads with the configured text-file size guard.

## 0.27.1

- Fail closed when HTTP MCP auth is required but `CODEXPRO_HTTP_TOKEN` is missing, including public tunnel mode and non-loopback binds.
- Block additional safe-bash bypass paths for absolute paths, parent paths, environment expansion, sensitive paths, and `find` write/action flags.
- Added smoke coverage for the missing-token HTTP startup failure and safe-bash blocked command cases.

## 0.27.0

- Kept terminal startup focused on only the connector URL and essential controls; usage prompts now belong in README/docs only.
- Made `git_diff` data-only instead of a widget-rendered tool. This reduces noisy ChatGPT cards and avoids template fetch failures for empty/no-op diffs.
- Kept visual cards scoped to high-signal outputs: source writes, exact edits, Pro context exports, and Codex handoffs.
- Updated smoke coverage so routine inspection tools stay compact.

## 0.26.0

- Removed prompt management from the terminal control panel.
- Removed the `s` hotkey and all launcher-side suggested prompt generation.
- Kept usage prompts and workflow examples in documentation instead of runtime UI.

## 0.25.0

- Simplified the ready screen so startup shows one compact status block instead of a long boxed next-step panel.
- Reduced visible controls to the common actions: open ChatGPT, copy URL, open status, copy prompt, help, and quit.
- Changed the `s` control to copy the suggested ChatGPT prompt instead of printing the full prompt repeatedly.
- Cleaned up saved setup list formatting so reused ngrok/Cloudflare profiles are easier to scan in narrow terminals.

## 0.24.0

- Added `codexpro settings list` to show all saved workspace tunnel profiles.
- Added `codexpro settings use` and `--from-root` to copy a saved setup from one workspace to another.
- Improved first-run `codexpro start` behavior: if the current workspace has no settings but other saved setups exist, CodexPro shows them as a numbered list so users can reuse an existing ngrok or Cloudflare setup instead of retyping hostnames.
- Expanded settings smoke coverage for profile listing and reuse.

## 0.23.0

- Added a compact first-run tunnel picker to `codexpro start` when no workspace settings exist, so users can choose Cloudflare quick, ngrok, Cloudflare stable, or local mode without running the full setup wizard.
- Added `codexpro settings` with `show`, `set`, and `delete --yes` actions for persistent per-workspace tunnel preferences.
- Persisted the selected tunnel provider, hostname, port, mode, and CodexPro token until the user changes or deletes the workspace settings.
- Added `scripts/settings-smoke.mjs` and included it in `npm run smoke`.

## 0.22.0

- Added the v5 Apps SDK widget resource at `ui://widget/codexpro-tool-card-v5.html` with cleaner pending states and more polished diff/search/code cards.
- Added a token-protected local setup/status page at `/` and `/setup` for workspace, mode, allowed-root, and ChatGPT setup visibility.
- Added the terminal `o` control to open the local setup/status page while CodexPro is running.
- Updated HTTP smoke coverage to verify the onboarding page and v5 widget resource.

## 0.21.0

- Added `codexpro doctor` as a read-only setup diagnostic for Node, build artifacts, workspace profiles, port availability, tunnel prerequisites, clipboard support, and browser-open support.
- Added `scripts/doctor-smoke.mjs` and included it in `npm run smoke`.
- Added `PUBLIC_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` with release gates, ChatGPT Developer Mode golden prompts, security checks, onboarding expectations, and current non-goals.
- Added `npm run doctor` and included the public launch checklist in the npm package surface.

## 0.20.0

- Made `codexpro setup` prompts clearer with a dim "Enter to proceed with default" hint before each defaulted input.
- Simplified the ready screen: the Server URL is described as already copied, and Enter is clearly labeled as opening ChatGPT connector settings.
- Added saved-profile hints so ngrok/Cloudflare stable setups tell users that future launches from the same workspace only need `codexpro start`.
- Added a local port preflight with clear guidance for running two repositories at the same time.
- Documented the multi-repo rule: each concurrent repo needs its own local port, and stable public tunnels need separate hostnames.

## 0.19.0

- Added per-workspace saved profiles under `~/.codexpro/profiles/`.
- `codexpro setup` now saves tunnel provider, hostname, port, mode, and a generated reusable CodexPro auth token by default.
- `codexpro start` now loads the saved profile for the current workspace unless `--no-profile` is passed.
- Added `--save-config`, `--no-save-config`, and `--no-profile` launcher flags.

## 0.18.0

- Added ngrok as a first-class tunnel mode with `codexpro ngrok --hostname <domain>` and `--tunnel ngrok`.
- Added ngrok support to the interactive `codexpro setup` public URL choices.
- Added ngrok executable/config resolution with clear setup errors for missing auth or unavailable domains.
- Documented reserved ngrok domains as a stable ChatGPT connector URL option.

## 0.17.0

- Added `codexpro setup` / `codexpro onboard` as an interactive onboarding wizard for workspace, port, mode, and public URL strategy.
- Reworked the launcher startup and ready screens into compact framed panels with status lines instead of long setup text.
- Added `npm run connect:setup` for source checkouts.
- Documented the guided onboarding path next to the one-command `codexpro start` flow.

## 0.16.0

- Reworked the widget pre-result state so in-progress tool calls show a compact running card instead of raw placeholder JSON.
- Added `codexpro stable` and `--stable` as shortcuts for Cloudflare named-tunnel mode.
- Added `codexpro stable-help` and friendlier missing-hostname guidance for fixed ChatGPT app URLs.
- Updated setup docs around stable URLs for users who cannot edit an existing ChatGPT app connector URL.

## 0.15.0

- Changed `codexpro start` to default to agent mode with workspace writes enabled.
- Added `--mode agent`, `--mode handoff`, `--mode pro`, plus shortcut flags `--agent`, `--handoff`, and `--pro-planning`.
- Reworked the terminal startup panel to copy the Server URL, hide long setup details by default, and expose details through controls.
- Updated the default suggested ChatGPT prompt so ChatGPT edits/writes/verifies directly instead of creating a handoff plan.
- Kept handoff and Pro-context workflows as explicit modes for planning-only use.

## 0.14.0

- Added cross-platform `cloudflared` bootstrap for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- CodexPro now reuses `cloudflared` from PATH first, then `~/.codexpro/bin`, then downloads the official Cloudflare release into `~/.codexpro/bin` when needed.
- Changed `--install-cloudflared` to force a user-local reinstall instead of using Homebrew.
- Added `codexpro install-cloudflared` for stable-domain setup without starting the MCP server.
- Kept `--no-install-cloudflared` as the opt-out for locked-down or manually managed machines.
- Updated setup docs with OS-specific notes for clipboard, browser opening, and Cloudflare Tunnel.

## 0.13.0

- Added an interactive CodexPro terminal control panel after startup.
- Added Enter-to-open ChatGPT connector settings, `c` to copy URL, `p` to print app fields, `s` to print the suggested prompt, and `q` to stop.
- Quieted local MCP and Cloudflare logs by default so startup reads like a product flow.
- Made macOS/Homebrew `cloudflared` installation automatic by default when missing.
- Added `--no-install-cloudflared` to opt out of automatic installation.
- Changed the default user-facing start command to `npx codexpro@latest start`.

## 0.12.0
